# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn ML foundations using 
python 3 , since the course repo was originally confined to
python 2.7. This will also help upcoming students who wish to take
introductiory ML course on udacity be able to do the course using 
python 3 rather than maintaing and using python 2.7
